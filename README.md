Group 5 Final Project
In this project we set out to test which type of machine learning model was best for predicting loan defaults.  Here we sourced banking data from Kaggle (see referenced link) and converted it into a Pandas Dataframe.  From there we created our training and testing data sets as well as applied a standard scaler to the data.  We evaluated the performance of 4 variations of machine learning models.  The models here are Random Forest, KNN, Kerras deep learning, and Logistic Regression Models. All four yielded accurate results.  The KNN model scored around 89, while the other three all scored around 91 at their peak.  We also made some charts using the data to gain a better understanding of it.  It was clearly a normally distrubted data set with loan defaults increasing seemingly only with volume.  However we determined that annuity amuount and income were two of the most relevant factors in whether or not a loan was repaid.  This would seem obvious, but this model also factors in social factors, like the amount of kids the loan holder has, whether they own a home or a car, what line of work they are in.  We were able to quanrify these variables through dummy creation.
